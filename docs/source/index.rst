Welcome to Python Parallel Computing Cookbook Glossary's documentation!
===================================

**Python Parallel Computing Cookbook Glossary** is a one of the notebooks I maintained for the books I read.

And the rst files in this repository follow the syntax outlined here: `Sphinx and RST syntax guide <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#headings/>`_.
